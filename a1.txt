● What is Emmet?
     Emmet is a tool that helps to speed up the process of writing HTML and CSS code. It is a plugin for text editors that provides 
        a set of abbreviations that can be expanded into full HTML or CSS code.
     Emmet abbreviations use a shorthand syntax that allows you to write code 
        quickly and efficiently. You can use Emmet to create complex HTML or CSS 
        structures with just a few keystrokes which can save you a lot of time when building websites.

     Emmet is available as a plugin for many popular text editors, including 
        Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, and Atom. It is also built into some
        web development tools, such as the Live Edit feature in Google Chrome.
        
 ● Difference between a Library and Framework?
     A library is a collection of code that provides a specific set of functions 
        or services that can be used by a program to perform certain tasks. 
        A library is typically designed to be flexible and reusable,
        meaning that it can be used in a variety of different programs and contexts.
     A framework is a set of libraries and tools that provides a structure for 
        building an application. A framework defines the architecture of an 
        application and provides a set of conventions and components that you can 
        use to build your application. Instead of writing all the code yourself,
        you use the components and conventions provided by the framework to build
        your application.

     In summary, a library is a collection of tools that you can use to solve 
       specific problems,
       while a framework is a structure that you can use to build an application.
       
      Example:
           In Python, NumPy is a library that provides functions for performing numerical operations,
           such as linear algebra and statistical analysis. Django is a web framework that provides 
           a structure for building web applications in Python.

           In Java, the Java Standard Library is a collection of libraries that provides a wide 
           range of functions, including input/output, networking, and data structures. 
           The Spring framework is a popular Java framework for building enterprise applications.

           In JavaScript, the React library is a popular library for building user interfaces,
           and the Angular framework is a popular framework for building web applications.

           In C++, the Boost library is a collection of libraries that provide a wide range 
           of functions, including data structures, algorithms, and utility functions.
           
           
           
  . What is CDN? Why do we use it?
           Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that are used to deliver web content to users based on their
                geographic location. CDNs are used to improve the performance and availability of websites by reducing the distance between the 
                website's server and the user's device.

           CDNs work by caching the static content of a website (such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files) on a network of servers
               located in strategic locations around the world. When a user requests a webpage from a website, the CDN sends the static content 
               from the nearest server to the user's device, rather than from the origin server. This reduces the time it takes to load the webpage,
               because the static content is delivered from a server that is closer to the user.
           
          There are several reasons why CDNs are used:

          Improved performance: CDNs improve the performance of websites by reducing the distance between the server and the user, which reduces the time it
                takes to load a webpage.

          Improved availability: CDNs can help improve the availability of a website by distributing the load across multiple servers and providing backup 
               servers in case of a failure.

          Reduced bandwidth costs: CDNs can help reduce bandwidth costs for website owners by offloading static content to the CDN's servers, rather than 
              serving it from the origin server.

           Improved security: CDNs can provide added security by blocking malicious traffic and protecting against DDoS attacks.


● Why is React known as React?
         React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces that was developed by Facebook. It is known as React because it was designed to "react" 
            to changes in the state of an application.
         The concept of "reacting" to changes in state is central to the design of React, and it is the reason why the library is named React.
 
 ● What is crossorigin in script tag?
         The crossorigin attribute in a script tag is used to specify the CORS policy for a script that is being loaded from an external source. 
                 CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature that prevents web pages from making requests to a different domain than the 
                 one that served the page.

         In the context of React, the crossorigin attribute is used to specify whether the script should be loaded with a CORS policy that allows it 
                to be used in a cross-origin manner (i.e., from a different domain than the one that served the page).
         Without the crossorigin attribute, the browser might block the script from being loaded or used by a page that is served from a different domain.
               This is because the default CORS policy for scripts is "same-origin", which means that the script can only be used by pages that are served 
               from the same domain as the script.
